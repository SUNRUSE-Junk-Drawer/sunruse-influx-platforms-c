# Given:
#	The platform instance.
#	An array of objects describing previously compiled native code:
#		code: String containing code to use when referencing this value.
#		value: The value object code was generated for.
#		working: String containing code generated to compute this value.
#	A value object being compiled into native code.
# Returns:
#	When a primitive constant was given, the appropiate string representing 
#		its value.
#	When a value object matching based on valuesEquivalent exists in the array 
#		of previously compiled native code, temp_(the zero-based index of the 
#		object).
#	When a native function, its function.generateCode is called with the array
#		of previously compiled native code as the first argument and the input
#		as the second.  The result is then stored in a new object in the array.
#	If none of these conditions pass, falsy.
